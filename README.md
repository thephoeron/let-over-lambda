##### 8/14/2014

##### 12/18/2013

Now available in the December 2013 distribution of Quicklisp

## Usage

Make sure you have the latest Quicklisp distribution, then include it as a dependency in your system definition, or from the REPL evaluate `(ql:quickload "let-over-lambda")`.

```lisp
(ql:quickload "let-over-lambda")
(lol:flatten '((A . B) (C . D) (E . (F G H (I . J) . K))))
=> (A B C D E F G H I J K)
```

LET-OVER-LAMBDA now uses the `named-readtables` library instead of modifying the global readtable. To use LOL reader macros in your Lisp source files, you will have to add both `let-over-lambda` and `named-readtables` to your project dependencies, and the following line after your call to `in-package`, in every source file you wish to use LOL syntax:

```lisp
(named-readtables:in-readtable lol:lol-syntax)
```
